# EGRET

EGRET (Estimating Genome-wide Regulatory Effects on the Transcriptome), a multivariate linear model designed to identify genomic loci that are predictive of gene expression levels. EGRET integrates predictions from existing trans-eQTL mapping approaches (Matrix eQTL, GBAT, and trans-PCO) and determines the optimal weighted combination of regulatory variants that best explains gene expression. Finally, EGRET utilizes a genome-wide summary statistics-based TWAS to identify novel gene-disease associations.
